<h1>The best movies according to George</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Avatar</h3>
<p>The first movie that convinced me 3D is the way forward to convey immersion and it also has a good story.
<h3>Avatar: The way of the water</h3>
<p>This movie took 3D to the next level. Visually stunning and vibrant in colours also brings storry telling to family audience.</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Great cinamatography and storry telling. one of the best Sci-fi movie to date.</p>
